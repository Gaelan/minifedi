Minifedi contains nginx configuration file templates derived from configuration
files provided by the Mastodon, Akkoma, and GoToSocial projects, all of which
are licensed under AGPLv3. My position is that these configuration files are
insufficiently creative to be copyrightable, but this is not legal advice.
